Through team work and the division of goals our group was able to complete all goal objectives, and some of the stretch goals. Trevor Van Engelhoven created the distortion effects, the extra fibbonaci distortion effects, the chorus effects, and the tremelo effects. Multiple of each effect were created to give the user a multitude of sounds to choose from. Trevor also thought up and created the effect which turns an uploaded image into a wave form. Trevor made the poster for presenting, and printed it. Charles Fortune took the responsibility of the real time application. He researched and implemented real time processing using a raspberry pi microcontroller and a conversion software called "Pure Noise". Charles converted effects in to wav files and additionally wrote the abstract. Skyler Hugo figured out how to generate each type of wave form. He made a slider effect which can move between the three main wave forms. Skyler also took effect code from numerous files and compiled them into a master effect file. This would allow for easier real time effect transition.
